				Cassandra Client

Cassandra Client is a database application that interacts with the Cassandra
NoSQL DBMS via Java Datastax driver, implemented as a Java API. Through this
driver, we interact w/Cassandra via Native Transport API and other protocols forcommunicating between Cassandra nodes and database app clients. In the future, I want to utilize this database app as a way to aggregate Big Data from multiple sources to perform write requests to Cassandra, and perform read requests of this data for training machine learning hypotheses.  All of this is a means of combining machine learning and cloud computing skills, which are all in high demand in the software engineering field. I want to put it all together.
